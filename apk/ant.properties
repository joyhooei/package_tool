#  'key.store' for the location of your keystore and
#  'key.alias' for the name of the key to use.
# The password will be asked during the build when you use the 'release' target.

#key.store=../../package_tool/apk/android.keystore
#key.alias=android
#key.store.password=qqqqqqqq
#key.alias.password=qqqqqqqq
